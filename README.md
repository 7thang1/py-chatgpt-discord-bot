- To deploy the stable version, modify the environment variables in the docker-compose file or replace .env.example with .env to run locally. Execute `docker compose up --build -d` command. I have not had the time to write documentation yet.
- To add a custom command, simply edit the config file. Don't worry, it will automatically generate the code for you on the first run.
